The Aetna stock, currently priced at 154.31 is down .63, which can be attributed partly to the dividend that was distributed to shareholders on 28th July, The moving averages over 5 and 10 days are 145.85 and 145.87, simple and exponential respectively, lesser than the current price, giving a strong buy signal. Over a period of 5 days, the MA varies between 101.3 to 103, further indicating a strong buy signal substantiated by two price crossovers. Furthermore, we expect Aetna to break resistance due its current underlying value and current dip in price, presenting the stock at a discounted rate. The RSI is at a value of 71.58, with the Stoch RSI at a 100, which may indicate an overbought situation, but having observed this indicator over time as compared to the resistance, which the stock has broken several times over the same period, and given the pre-existing conditions still prevail, we believe the growth trend of the Aetna stock will continue over the period of a month.
